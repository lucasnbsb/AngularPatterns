    Is the component you are creating better described as a "styled html
    element"? If so, It should be a directive. Here's why:
  </p>
  <p>
    If you wrap a native html element like a button into a component, then to
    get the bare minimum feature parity you need to add most attributes for that
    element as inputs to the component and then pipe them into the element.

    <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#popovertarget"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noreferrer"
      >popovertarget</a
    >
    into your buttons?</i

  <p>
    Instead write a directive and apply it to the desired element to style,
    animate or add behavior. Daisy-ui-style classes are also an option here.
  </p>

  <p>Here's a bunch of buttons done with an example directive:</p>
  <div class="flex items-center gap-1">
    <button customButton variant="primary">Btn Primary</button>
    <button customButton variant="secondary">Btn Secondary</button>
    <button customButton variant="error">Btn Error</button>
  </div>
  <p>
    <i
      >Those are obviously usinig DaisyUi classes for styles, i'm not about to
      write css in my free time</i
    >
