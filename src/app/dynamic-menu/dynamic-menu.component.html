    Here's the problem. <b>Dynamic content on menus,</b> the more flexibility
    you need, the less options you have.
  </p>

  <p>In my opinion a good solution should have the following:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Be dynamic, pass an array of menu items and get a menu</li>
    <li>Support submenus out of the box</li>
    <li>
      Allow opening from a trigger element, mouse event (context menu or
      otherwise), or just programmatically from any source
    </li>
    <li>
      Allow for conditional rendering of menu items asynchronously, we don't
      want to wait for our authorization system to return to open the menu
    </li>
    <li>
      Minimize layout shifts whenever possible by rendering a loading
      placeholder
    </li>
    <li>Be accessible, support keyboard navigation</li>
    <li>React to it's position in the screen automatically</li>
    <li>Keep dependencies limited to angular material and the cdk</li>
  </ol>

  So that leaves us with 3 options:

  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>CdkOverlay:</b> you have to build everything, submenus, position,
      behavior on detach, etc
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>CdkMenu:</b> Least helpful one of the bunch, submenu behavior is
      heavily tied into the context of the rest of the menu, the api is very
      unhelpful if you stray from the examples
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>MatMenu:</b> not really meant to be used as a context menu, so opening
      it has to be done through the trigger directive. But other than that it
      fullfills all of the requirements
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    So here's the solution. Wrap <code>mat-menu</code> into a component that
    shifts around a hidden element with the trigger for the menu to allow for
    programmatic opening and do some RxJs magic to conditionally render the menu
    items.
  </p>

  <p>
    The menu options can be pre-resolved by a shareReplay observable with the
    conditions being pre-warmed before opening the menu
  </p>

  <!-- This is the only footprint of the menu in the dom -->
  <app-overlay-menu #reusableMenu [menuItems]="menuItems"></app-overlay-menu>

  <div class="flex items-center gap-4">
    <div
      class="w-fit rounded-lg border-2 border-dashed border-primary p-2"
      (contextmenu)="$event.preventDefault(); triggerMenu($event)"
    >
      Context menu area
    </div>

    <div>
      <button
        class="btn btn-primary"
        [matMenuTriggerFor]="reusableMenu.outerMenu"
      >
        Trigger from a button
      </button>
    </div>

    <div>
      <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="openMenuInRandomPosition()">
        Trigger programmatically in arbitraty position
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>

  <app-external-code-panel [references]="references"></app-external-code-panel>
</app-card-layout>
